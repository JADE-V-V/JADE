# JADE
The JADE tool provides an automated framework to perform validation and verification of nuclear data libraries and particle transport codes. 
JADE is brought to you by NIER, University of Bologna (UNIBO), Fusion For Energy (F4E) and the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA).

Detailed documentation on the usage of JADE can be found on the Read the Docs for the [latest](https://jade-a-nuclear-data-libraries-vv-tool.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) version.
