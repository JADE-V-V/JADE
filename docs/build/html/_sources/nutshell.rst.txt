JADE is an open source, Python 3 based software able to:

* automatically build a series of MCNP input file using different nuclear
  data libraries;
* automatically run simulations on such inputs;
* automatically parse and post-process all the generated MCNP outputs.

The benchmarks implemented by default are divided between computational
and experimental benchmarks. The post-processing output includes:

* raw data in .csv files containing the entire tallied output from the
  simulations;
* formatted Excel recap files;
* Word and PDF atlas collecting the plots generated during the post-processing.

Additional JADE features are:

* the possibility to implement user-defined benchmarks;
* operate on the material card of an MCNP input (e.g. create material mixtures
  or translate it to a different nuclear data library);
* print a recap of the material composition of an MCNP input.
