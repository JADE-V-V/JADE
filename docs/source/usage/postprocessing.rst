Post-Processing
###############

Three types of outputs are available in jade: the raw data, excel output and atlas output.

Raw data
========
Once the simulations have been performed, the raw data can be generated by running
in the root directory from the command line:
```
jade --raw
```

or

```
python -m jade --raw
```

This command will scan all available simulation results and produce the raw data for
those simulations for wich the data was not generated yet. These files are stored in the
``raw_data`` folder in the root directory of the project. Their format are simple .csv tables.

These files are the interface between the results processing which is transport code dependent
and the post-processing which is transport code independent. This means that the user is free
to build its own post-processing in case the one provided by JADE are not sufficient. A file
is produced for each result (i.e. a nuclear response) in each benchmark run.
