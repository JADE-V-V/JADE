JADE in a nutshell
##################

JADE is an open source, Python 3 based software able to:
* Build a series of MCNP input file to be tested;
* Run sequentially a default series of computational or experimental benchmark;
* Employ a user-defined benchmark;
* Automatically post-process all the MCNP outputs;
* Create Excel recap response files;
* Create dedicate atlas in which the computed energy fluxes are compared;
* Check the correctness of a ACE cross section library;
* Compare responses from two or more ACE cross section libraries;
* Help the preparation and technical review of MCNP material cards thanks to dedicated side tools.
