    General OOP scheme for the JADE code

All user interactions that happen through the command console are handled
by the ``gui.py module``. When JADE is started, a ``main.Session()`` object
is intialized which is a container for a series of information and tools
that many parts of the code may need to access. In particular it contains:

Paths
    through ``main.Session()`` it is possible to recover many paths to the
    different folders that constitutes the JADE tree (see also :ref:`folders`).
Status
    the ``state.Status()`` object has informations on which libraries have
    been assessed or post-processed.
Configuration
    the ``configuration.Configuration()`` object is the one that handles the
    parsing of the :ref:`mainconfig` file.
Library Manager
    the ``libmanager.LibManager()`` is responsible for all operations related
    to nuclear data libraries. These include for instance checking the
    availability of a library, or handling the translation of a single isotope.
