JADE is a new tool for nuclear libraries V&V.
Brought to you by NIER, University of Bologna (UNIBO), Fusion For Energy (F4E),
and UK Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA).
JADE is an open source, system agnostic, Python 3 based software able to:

* automatically build a series of MCNP input file using different nuclear
  data libraries;
* sequentially run simulations on such inputs;
* automatically parse and post-process all the generated MCNP outputs
  (e.g. mctal and fmesh).

The benchmarks implemented by default are divided between computational
and experimental benchmarks. The post-processing output includes:

* raw data in .csv files containing the entire tallied output from the
  simulations;
* formatted Excel recap files;
* Word and PDF atlas collecting the plots generated during the post-processing.

Additional JADE features are:

* run JADE with the transport codes OpenMC and Serpent. 
* the possibility to implement user-defined benchmarks;
* operate on the material card of an MCNP input (e.g. create material mixtures, 
  translate it to a different nuclear data library or switch between atom and
  mass fraction);
* print a recap of the material composition of an MCNP input;
* modify the suffix of .ace library;
* produce default reaction file for D1S-UNED MCNP patch inputs.
