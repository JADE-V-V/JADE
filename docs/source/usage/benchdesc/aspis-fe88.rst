ASPIS Iron-88 benchmark
-----------------------------

The ASPIS experiment was designed for providing information of benchmark quality
for testing of data and calculation methods for deep-penetration profile by 
natural iron shielding material.

The ASPIS shielding facility is installed on the NESTOR reactor at Winfrith.
NESTOR is a light water cooled, graphite and light water moderated reactor 
which operates at powers of up to 30 kW and is used as a source of neutrons 
for a wide range of applications. The core of the reactor, is contained within an 
annulus formed by two concentric aluminium vessels through which water 
circulates. The inner vessel is filled with graphite to form an inner 
reflector. The outer tank is surrounded by an external graphite reflector 
in the form of a block having dimensions 182 cm x 182 cm x 122 cm which 
contains the control plate slots adjacent to the vessel wall. Leading off 
each of the four faces of the external reflector is an experiment cave 
which can be isolated from the reactor by shutters composed of boral or 
combinations of neutron/gamma-ray shield materials.

ASPIS is located in the NESTOR cave C. Shield components, which are in the 
main slabs or tanks, are mounted vertically in a mobile tank which has an 
internal cross-sectional area of 1.8 m x 1.9 m and a length of 3.7 m. A 
fission plate is located within the experimental shield array. The loaded 
tank is moved into the cave where thermal neutrons leaking from the outer 
graphite reflector of NESTOR are used to drive the fission plate to provide 
a well defined neutron source for penetration measurements. 

The neutron flux levels within an ASPIS shield contain contributions from 
sources in the fission plate and from the NESTOR core and it is essential 
that the NESTOR contribution is subtracted from all measured responses to 
arrive at the response resulting from the fission plate sources. 

Experimental results derived from ASPIS-Fe88 experiment are publicly accessible at
the `CoNDERC database <https://nds.iaea.org/conderc/shield-fns>`_.

Geometry and run parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Iron 88 Benchmark experimental array irradiated in the ASPIS shielding 
facility is shown schematically in side elevation in the figure below.

    benchmark experiment

The array 
comprises three regions: the source region containing moderator and the 
fission plate, the shield made from 13 mild steel plates, each of 
approximately 5.1 cm thickness, and a deep backing shield manufactured from 
mild and stainless steel. To allow detector access within the shield 6 mm 
spacers are placed between each slab component. In practice the depth of 
the air gaps varies owing to positional uncertainties of the plates and 
their flatness. The 6 mm gap is therefore nominal and an average gap of 
7.4 mm was measured for the experiment. 

The outer boundaries of the 
experimental region are formed by the walls and floor of the ASPIS trolley
and by the roof of the ASPIS cave. The floor and walls of the trolley are 
manufactured from 1.91 cm thick mild steel plate. The trolley base has a 
25 cm high steel chassis in-filled with concrete. The structure of NESTOR 
surrounding the trolley comprises concrete bulk shielding blocks except on 
the NESTOR core side of the trolley front face where it is graphite. This 
graphite extends away from the trolley to the external graphite reflector 
of the reactor.
    
A schematic diagram of the fission plate is shown in the figure below.

It comprises an aluminium frame which fills the height and width of the ASPIS trolley. 
Located within the frame there are 13 separate fuel elements.
Each element has two 12 mm thick aluminium cover plates which attach on either 
side of the top and bottom locating end pieces leaving a 5 mm separation in which
U/Al alloy fuel strips are located. 
The fuel strips are 80% by weight aluminium and 
20% by weight of uranium enriched to 93% having a density of 3.256 g/cm3. 
Each strip is nominally 30.5 mm wide and 1 mm thick and is fixed to the 
rear cover plate by M5 screws.

Three columns of fuel strips laid side by side fill the width of the 
element. There is depth for 4 fuel strips within each element leaving a 
1 mm clearance gap next to the front cover plate. In the current 
configuration only the central two strips in each column contain U/Al 
alloy, the outer two are both blanks manufactured from aluminium.

The centre of the
fuel is at a height of 889 mm from the floor of the trolley and at 889 mm 
from the right hand wall of the trolley when looking towards the NESTOR
core. The measurements were made on this axis.

The absolute power in the fission plate, expressed as plate Watts per 
NESTOR Watt, has been determined by combining measurements of the absolute 
fission-rate at spot values, gained by fission product decay line counting, 
with the fission-rate profile data. The analysis is rather 
involved and the result was an absolute plate power of 5.68E-4 Watts per 
NESTOR Watt.

The detectors used for the measurements were:

Detector activation measurements were carried out along the fission
plate axis at the following shield thicknesses: 0, 5.1, 10.22, 15.34, 
20.44, 25.64, 30.79, 35.99, 41.19, 46.44, 51.62, 56.69, 61.81, 66.99 cm. 
Al-27 reaction rates were measured only up to 25.64 cm.

The results were corrected for the background responses due to the NESTOR
core. Using the hydrogen filled proportional counters the correction was 
found to be around 2% throughout the shield for the four threshold 
detectors. For gold measurements the measurement was repeated with the 
fissile content of the fission plate removed in order to determine the 
background correction.


MCNP modelling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
5 MCNP inputs, corresponding to the experimental setup with the 5 different foils
were used.
A F4 reaction rate tally is defined for each input:

Tally n. 4
  A track length flux tally has been used to collect results in the cells
  corresponding to the activation foils in MCNP geometry. The tally has been
  multiplied in each input (with FM card) by the appropriate microscopic 
  reaction cross section, to obtain results in terms of number of reactions 
  per unit neutron from the source. No energy bins were used. Nuclear data for
  tally collection was taken from IRDFF dosimetry libraries. In the following,
  a list of the reactions considered for each activation foil material is
  reported:

  * Rh-103(n,n')Rh-103
  * Al-27(n,a)Na-24
  * In-115(n,n')In-115m
  * S-32(n,p)P-32
  * Au-197(n,g)Au-198

A FM multiplier card with the normalization factor has been used to obtain the results in
units of reactions per second per atom at 30 kW NESTOR power.
