# JADE-CODE
Developing Jade Repository

This is just a place were to note what will have to appear in the final README

- conda update required
- python-docx required (probably the conda-forge channel has to be activated to install it)

Now the structure of JADE is self-described. To install it you simply download the folder and put it inside your decided JADE folder.
Then you have to copy the benchmark input folder there (it would have been too heavy to distribute it with git) and the remaining folders
structure will be created automatically the first time you run the suite.
