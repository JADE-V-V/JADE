Welcome to JADE's documentation!
================================
Version: |release|

JADE is a Verification & Validation (V&V) framework for nuclear data libraries and transport codes.
Use JADE to automatically generate, run and post-process benchmarks and compare the results obtained
using different nuclear data libraries and transport codes combinations.

JADE is an open-source software licensed under the :ref:`gnulicense` and it is
hosted on GitHub `here <https://github.com/JADE-V-V/JADE>`_.

Development was initially started in 2019 by NIER, University of Bologna (UNIBO) and Fusion For Energy (F4E),
and it is today carried out mainly by F4E and the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA).
You can find an up to date and detailed list of contributors in the :ref:`contributor_list` section.
