Test Blanket Module
-------------------
Tritium and Deuterium are the two main ingredients of the fusion reaction that is
foreseen to be tested in ITER and that should guarantee sustainable energy production
in DEMO. Deuterium is abundant in normal sea water and can be extracted relatively
easily. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for Tritium, whose short half life
means that is not readily available in nature. For this reason, in order to be
sustainable, TOKAMAKs will need to be able to produce, or "breed" all the tritium
needed for their fusion reactions. Tritium breeding is not foreseen for the ITER
power plant and the open point will need to be closed by DEMO instead. Nevertheless,
ITER is a unique opportunity to test various breeding concepts and find out what
will be the best solution to implement in DEMO, leading to the creation of the
Test Blanket Module (TBM) project. These are prototypes of blanket sections (and
their ancillaries) which have the capability to breed and store tritium for later
use.

Building on the historical ITER 1D model, in 2020,
two additional benchmark were generated by the F4E neutronic
team which had a specific focus on the ITER TBM experiments. The ITER 1D original
model was focused on shielding application and did not feature any port in the
outboard region. On the contrary, in the new benchmarks, the outboard region was
substituted with 1D models of the two proposed European concepts for the TBM: the
Helium Cooled Pebbled bed (HCPB) and the Water Cooled Lithium Lead (WCLL).
This substitution is the only modification applied to the :ref:`iter1ddesc`.

Geometry and run parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The benchmarks are focused on the TBM set (i.e. the actual blanket module) and on
the shielding section that can be found behind it. While the shield section does
not really
change between the two different TBM concepts, the TBM sets do.

Tallies
^^^^^^^

All Tritium production tallies that were defined for the ITER 1D benchmark
were retained also in the TBMs ones.
Additionally, a 1-dimensional FMESH was placed on the outboard region
(from R=830 up to R=1084.2) composed by 2000 bins. The following quantities
were tallied on such grid:

Tally n. 214
    Neutron heating [MeV/cm^3/n_s.
Tally n. 224
    Photon heating [MeV/cm^3/n_s].
Tally n. 234
    Tritium production [atoms/cm^3/n_s].
Tally n. 244
    Neutron flux [#/cm^3/n_s].
Tally n. 254
    Photon flux [#/cm^3/n_s].
