JADE is a tool for validation and verification (V&V) of nuclear data libraries.
Development was initially started by NIER, University of Bologna (UNIBO) and Fusion For Energy (F4E),
and it is today carried out mainly by F4E and the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA).
You can find an up to date and detailed list of contributors in the :ref:`contributor_list` section.

JADE is an open source, Python 3 based software able to:

* Automatically build a series of MCNP input files using different nuclear
  data libraries;
* Run simulations on such inputs;
* Automatically parse and post-process all the generated transport codes outputs.

MCNP input and output handling is performed by F4Enix (`f4enix documentation <https://f4enix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_).
This package contains a range of utilities for the creation and post-processing of MCNP files.

The benchmarks implemented by default are divided between computational
and experimental benchmarks. The post-processing output includes:

* Raw data in *.csv* files containing the entire tallied output from the
  simulations;
* Formatted Excel recap files;
* Word files collecting the plots generated during the post-processing.

Additional JADE features are:

* Run JADE with the transport codes OpenMC and Serpent for the sphere leakage benchmark.
* The possibility to implement user-defined benchmarks;
* Operate on the material definitions (e.g. create material mixtures, 
  translate it to a different nuclear data library or switch between atom and
  mass fraction);
* Print a recap of the material composition of an MCNP input;
* Modify the suffix of .ace library;
* Produce default reaction file for D1S-UNED MCNP patch inputs.
