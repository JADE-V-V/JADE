ITER CYLYNDER SDDR
------------------

The ITER Cylinder SDDR is a very popular computational benchmark for
SDDR computation in ITER since it features dimensions, materials and
streaming characteristics of a typical ITER equatorial port.

    ITER Cylinder SDDR benchmark geometry visualization

The ITER Cylinder SDDR is a simple yet effective benchmark. The model
is composed by a 550 cm long, hollowed steel cylinder with internal and
external radius respectively equal to 50 cm and 100 cm. The rear part of
the cylinder is closed with a steel disk plate of 48 cm radius and 15 cm thick.
The inner front part of the cylinder is filled with a smaller cylinder made
of a water-steel mixture. This internal 48 cm radius cylinder is 210 cm long
and features a central 15 cm diameter cylindrical hole. As it can be deducted
from the given measures, a 2 cm gap is left between the main external hollow
cylinder and its internal components.

A volumetric and isotropic 14 MeV neutron source is also defined. The volume of
emission is a disk aligned with the front part of the cylinder assembly and
positioned at a distance of 100 cm. The volume of the disk is 10 cm thick and
has a radius equal to 100 cm.

A series of cells and surfaces is also defined for tallying purposes.
The shutdown dose rate due to the activation of the assembly is evaluated in cell
tallies located 30 cm past the end of the rear plate. The tally cells consist of
concentric (hollow) disks which are 10 cm thick and are characterized from the
following radii:

* from 0 cm to 15 cm (MCNP cell n. 10);
* from 15 cm to 30 cm (MCNP cell n. 11);
* from 30 cm to 45 cm (MCNP cell n. 12);
* from 45 cm to 60 cm (MCNP cell n. 13).

For flux tallying purposes, instead, the following cylindrical surfaces have been defined:

* n. 1, coincident with the external surface of the central hole;
* n. 2, coincident with the external surface of the water/steel cylinder;
* n. 3, coincident with the internal surface of the main steel cylinder;
* n. 4, coincident with the external surface of the main steel cylinder;

and the following planes orthogonal to the cylinder length:

* n. 22, coincident with the front of the assembly;
* n. 23, coincident with the rear of the water/steel cylinder;
* n. 24, coincident with the front of the rear plate;
* n. 25, coincident with the rear of the assembly.

Two different cool-down times were considered in the photon tallies: 0s and 1e6 s (approx. 11.5 days).
That is, these are the time interval waited after the irradiation phase has finished before tallying
the SDDR and the photon flux.

Tallies
^^^^^^^

Neutron flux, (decay) gamma flux and SDDR are the only tallied quantities. The following
is a description of the tallies defined in the benchmark:

Tally n. 202
    Neutron flux per energy bin [#/cm^2/s]. The flux is tallied in 16 energy bins ranging between 1E-10 MeV to 20 MeV. The flux is also binned geometrically.
Tally n. 242
    Total neutron flux [#/cm^2/s]. Same as Tally n. 202 but without the energy binning.
Tally n. 14 
    Gamma flux per energy bin in cell 10 [#/cm^2/s]. The flux is tallied in 16 energy bins ranging from 0.1 MeV to 20 MeV. The flux is tallied at both cool-down times.
Tally n. 34
    Gamma flux per energy bin in cell 11 [#/cm^2/s]. The flux is tallied in 16 energy bins ranging from 0.1 MeV to 20 MeV. The flux is tallied at both cool-down times.
Tally n. 44
    Gamma flux per energy bin in cell 12 [#/cm^2/s]. The flux is tallied in 16 energy bins ranging from 0.1 MeV to 20 MeV. The flux is tallied at both cool-down times.
Tally n. 54
    Gamma flux per energy bin in cell 13 [#/cm^2/s]. The flux is tallied in 16 energy bins ranging from 0.1 MeV to 20 MeV. The flux is tallied at both cool-down times.
Tally n. 74
    Total gamma flux [#/cm^2/s]. The flux is tallied only by cell (i.e. 10, 11, 12 and 13).
Tally n. 124
    SSDR behind the plate [Sv/h]. The SDDR is computed at all cell tallies (i.e. 10, 11, 12 and 13) and at both cool-down times.
