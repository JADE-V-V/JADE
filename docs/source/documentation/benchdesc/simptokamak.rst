    Simple Tokamak geometry (xy)

The simplified tokamak is a 60 degree model with a representation of 
the major components of a tokamak. Owing to its simplicity, this model is well suited to transport code 
benchmarking while being representative of geometry and energy regimes in the nuclear 
analysis of fusion devices.

Geometry and run parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Reflecting planes are included on the lateral bounds of the 
sector to approximate the toroidal symmetry of the tokamak.  Typical materials for a 
tokamak are used in a homogenized form for the blanket, divertor, vacuum vessel,
ports, toroidal and poloidal field coils and the bioshield. In total, the model has
168 cells, 344 surfaces and 92 nuclides. The source term is an isotropic point source 
emitting neutrons with an energy of 14 MeV positioned in the center of the plasma
region of the geometry.
The cells numbers have been labeled arbitrary assigning a more descriptive name for
each component. For instance the first number is related to the z coordinates
(up or down) as shown in the Figure below, while in the case of the breeding blanket
cells the second number depends on the toroidal location (y coordinate).
