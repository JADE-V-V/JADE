JADE is a new tool for nuclear libraries V&V.
Brought to you by NIER, University of Bologna (UNIBO), Fusion For Energy (F4E),
and the UK Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA).
JADE is an open source, Python 3 based software able to:

* Automatically build a series of MCNP input file using different nuclear
  data libraries;
* Run simulations on such inputs;
* Automatically parse and post-process all the generated transport codes outputs.

The benchmarks implemented by default are divided between computational
and experimental benchmarks. The post-processing output includes:

* Raw data in *.csv* files containing the entire tallied output from the
  simulations;
* Formatted Excel recap files;
* Word and PDF atlas files collecting the plots generated during the post-processing.

Additional JADE features are:

* Run JADE with the transport codes OpenMC and Serpent.
* The possibility to implement user-defined benchmarks;
* Operate on the material definitions (e.g. create material mixtures, 
  translate it to a different nuclear data library or switch between atom and
  mass fraction);
* Print a recap of the material composition of an MCNP input;
* Modify the suffix of .ace library;
* Produce default reaction file for D1S-UNED MCNP patch inputs.
